Managing Director’s Statement\\nDear esteemed shareholders,\\nIndia’s significance in the global economic landscape has \\nenhanced mani-fold over the past decade. In this world of \\nvolatility and uncertainty, India is shining as a beacon of \\nstability and prosperity. Robust growth across all sectors, \\nfuelled by the collective ‘can do’ spirit of 1.4 billion Indians \\nand bolstered by our rich heritage, is steadily driving the \\nnation’s economic progress. \\nWith the launch of Jio 4G in 2016, we \\nset out on a journey to make digital \\ninclusion in India a reality. Jio turned \\na Data Dark India into a Data Rich \\nnation, supplying every Indian home \\nwith affordable, high-speed 4G data. \\nAnd this year, Jio has further enhanced \\nthe country’s digital infrastructure by \\nrolling out its True5G network across \\nIndia in world-record time. \\nThe launch of JioBharat phone was \\nanother revolutionary step towards \\nbridging the country’s digital divide. \\nA smartphone at the price of a \\nfeature phone, the JioBharat phone \\nwill go a long way in the realisation \\nof a 2G-mukt Bharat. We are also \\nmaking concerted efforts in building \\ncapabilities in evolving technologies \\nsuch as AI/ML, AR/VR, robotics, \\nnatural language recognition and \\nprocessing. The world is increasingly \\nrecognising India as an innovation hub, \\nand Jio will continue to play a stellar \\nrole in building the nation’s digital \\ninfrastructure and capabilities.\\nThe changing demography of India \\ntoo is scripting our growth story. The \\nworking population has soared to \\n~450 million, and household incomes \\nare on an upward trajectory. There is \\nvisible improvement in the quality of \\nlife of common people. With increase \\nin disposable income, the demand \\nfor goods and services is expanding \\nrapidly. As India’s largest retailer, \\nReliance Retail is perfectly positioned \\nto serve the consumption needs of \\nour fast-growing economy. With our \\nall-encompassing range of products, \\nwe have become an integral part of \\nthe lives of our consumers across the \\nnation. Our New Commerce initiative \\nis also playing an important role in \\nsupporting small indigenous merchants \\nand kirana shop owners – the very \\nbackbone of the retail supply chain of \\nour nation. \\nThis year we introduced our first \\n‘Swadesh’ store, promoting traditional \\nart forms, as well as artisans. We have \\nalways believed that the demand \\nfor India’s age-old crafts is at par \\nwith prominent global brands, and \\nour belief has been vindicated by \\nthe overwhelming response to our \\nSwadesh stores.\\nThe world is now realising the \\nenormous potential of India. \\n‘Invest in India’ is being advocated \\nglobally. Reliance Retail’s vision of \\ninclusive development for millions of \\nconsumers and merchants, coupled \\nwith unprecedented growth of the \\nIndian marketplace, has resulted in \\nmarquee names investing in RRVL at \\na\\xa0US$\\xa0100\\xa0billion valuation milestone.\\nThe Media and Entertainment business \\nalso made impressive progress this \\nyear. We believe in the potential of \\ntalented artistes and storytellers of our \\ncountry and continue to promote their \\nprojects. To cater to the evolving tastes \\nof Indian audiences, we bring together \\na blend of premium global and home-\\ngrown content through multiple \\nconsumption platforms. As Indians, \\nwe nurture a passion for sports and \\nwork towards making exciting sports \\ncontent available to our viewers.\\nTeaming up with global media \\npowerhouses, we are pooling together \\nspectacular content for the Indian \\ndiaspora. With a package replete with \\nquality media productions, sports \\nevents, and news platforms, we \\ncontinue to work towards providing the \\nbest of news coverage, infotainment, \\nand entertainment to millions \\nof Indians.\\nOver the past couple of years, volatility \\nin trade flows and supply chain \\ndisruptions have affected the energy \\nsufficiency of multiple economies. \\nWith visionary and prudent leadership, \\nthe resilience and stability of the Indian \\neconomy amid such a global crisis is \\ntruly unparalleled. The Oil and Gas \\ndivision of Reliance has performed \\nan outstanding job in strengthening \\nIndia’s energy security. With the \\ncommissioning of MJ Field, KG-D6 \\nblock now accounts for ~30% of India’s \\ndomestic gas production. \\nAs the world’s largest single-site \\nrefinery operator, we continue to \\ndiligently work towards ensuring a \\nsteady supply of fuel to both India and \\noffshore markets. Our fuel-retailing \\nJV, Jio-bp, focuses on innovation \\nand customisable indigenous \\nsolutions to improve fuel efficiency at \\naffordable prices. Our fast-growing \\nnetwork of EV charging stations \\nenable the development of a robust \\ninfrastructure to support the growing \\nfleet of EVs in India. Moreover, it \\nunderscores Reliance’s commitment \\ntowards decarbonisation.\\nLeading  \\nIndia’s Inclusive \\nGrowth Story\\nShri. Mukesh D. Ambani\\nChairman and Managing Director,  \\nReliance Industries Limited\\nIt is this spirit of India and Indians \\nthat inspires Reliance to innovate \\nrelentlessly and excel in every venture. \\nIt is a matter of immense pride for the \\nReliance Family to be a part of India’s \\ngrowth story and contribute to its \\nmeteoric rise.\\n6 7\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='8 9\\nReliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nChairman and Managing Director’s Statement\\nHighlights of Operational \\nPerformance\\nDigital Services\\nJio’s subscriber base has shot up to \\n481.8 million. The pan-India rollout \\nof True5G network was completed \\nduring the year in world-record time \\nwith over 108 million subscribers \\nalready having migrated to Jio’s True5G \\nnetwork. The launch of JioAirFiber has \\nbeen well received by consumers. The \\nintroduction of JioBharat phone offers \\npeople who are on 2G networks an \\nenriching data experience at affordable \\nprices. In fact, JioBharat phone has \\nalready acquired 50% market share in \\nthe sub- C 1,000 segment.\\nRetail\\nThe retail business significantly \\nbenefited from operating leverage, \\nefficiency gains, and investments in \\ntechnology and people. We continued \\nto consolidate our leadership position \\nthrough acquisitions and partnerships. \\nWe launched Tira, our omni-channel \\nbeauty retail platform and undertook \\nrapid expansion of the platform’s \\ndigital and physical footprint. Our \\nretail\\xa0store network expanded to \\n18,836 stores, taking the overall \\nretail space to 79.1 million sq.ft., an \\nincrease of 20.6% Y-o-Y. Addition of \\nnewer features and channels on online \\nplatforms resulted in growing share of \\ndigital and new commerce segments \\nin revenue.\\nThe Industrial and Infrastructure \\nsectors in India exhibit an exceptional \\ngrowth trajectory. Today’s India \\nemploys futuristic techniques to build \\nrobust, reliable, and lasting solutions. \\nReliance’s petrochemical products \\ncontinue to contribute heavily to the \\nfast-paced growth of new India. The \\nconcept of circularity has always been \\nan inherent component of our chemical \\nbusiness. With immense pride I say \\nthat Reliance has become the first \\nIndian company to chemically recycle \\nplastic waste-based pyrolysis oil into \\ncircular polymers. This, along with other \\npioneering initiatives such as recycled \\npolyester, recycled polyolefins, and \\nwaste-to-road solutions, is testimony to \\nReliance’s relentless drive for greener \\nproducts and solutions.\\nAs we work towards our goal of \\nattaining Net Carbon Zero by the \\nyear 2035, the development of the \\nDhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga \\nComplex in Jamnagar is progressing \\nrapidly. This giga complex will be one \\nof the largest end-to-end integrated \\nrenewable energy manufacturing \\nfacilities globally. We are also exploring \\nmultiple technologies for capture and \\nrecycling of carbon. We are confident \\nthat our New Energy business will play \\na pivotal role in the global movement \\nfor adoption of cleaner fuels.\\nOur target is \\nnot just to make \\nclean\\xa0energy \\navailable, but \\nalso to make it \\naccessible and \\naffordable, thereby \\nensuring energy \\nself‑sufficiency \\nfor\\xa0India. \\nMedia and Entertainment\\nMedia segment consolidated its market \\nshare with leadership across important \\nsegments. Record viewership of the \\nIndian Premier League on JioCinema \\nunderscored our ability to scale-up \\naudience on our digital platform in a \\nshort time. \\nDuring the year, we entered into a \\nlandmark agreement with The Walt \\nDisney Company, world’s leading \\nmedia company, for creating a \\njoint venture which combines the \\nbusinesses of Viacom 18 and Star \\nIndia. The resultant JV will be one \\nof the leading television and digital \\nstreaming platforms in India, bringing \\nbest-in-class entertainment for our \\naudience across the country.\\nOil to Chemicals\\nProduct cracks for transportation \\nfuels remained strong albeit lower \\nthan the previous year. Demand \\nfor downstream chemicals was \\nmuted globally but domestic \\ndemand remained healthy. Despite \\nthe headwinds, the O2C business \\nregistered a resilient performance. \\nJio-bp launched the ‘You Deserve \\nMore’ campaign and continued to \\nexpand its network of fuel retailing \\nand\\xa0EV\\xa0charging outlets.\\nWith such a comprehensive approach \\ntowards decarbonisation, our new \\nenergy and new materials business is \\npoised to become one of the largest \\nproviders of green energy globally, as \\nwell as a prime contributor towards \\nIndia’s 2070 net zero target.\\nAccelerating Towards \\nNet\\xa0Carbon Zero\\nReliance has defined a \\ncomprehensive roadmap leading \\nto our ambitious Net Carbon Zero \\ntarget. We are focused on investing \\nin right talent to ensure superior \\nexecution of our decarbonisation \\nplans. Our ESG Committee is doing \\nan exemplary job in reviewing and \\nevaluating the Company’s progress. \\nOur think-tank, the New Energy \\nCouncil, is providing critical insights \\nabout utility and adoption of nascent, \\nunconventional technologies.\\nOur R&D teams are working round-\\nthe-clock, devising solutions that \\ncan leverage novel techniques in the \\ncarbon recycling process. \\nWe have a strong background of \\nsuccessfully introducing pioneering \\ntransformations and gaining \\nleadership status across market \\nsegments.

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \\nfinancial reporting\\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \\nas a key audit matter for the Company because its financial \\naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant \\non IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction \\nvolumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material \\nconsumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes \\nand the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the \\nCompany’s systems and data, cyber security has become \\nmore significant. Automated accounting procedures and \\nIT environment controls, which include IT governance, IT \\ngeneral controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations, IT application \\ncontrols and interfaces between IT applications, are required \\nto be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate \\nfinancial reporting.\\nOur procedures included and were not limited to the following:\\n − Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging \\nIT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and \\ninternal audit at the Company and identified IT applications \\nthat are relevant to our audit.\\n − Tested the design, implementation and operating\\xa0effectiveness \\nof IT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\n − Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity \\nat the Company in respect of the overall security architecture \\nand any key threats addressed by the Company in the \\ncurrent year.\\n − Tested the design, implementation and operating\\xa0effectiveness \\nof IT application controls in the key processes impacting \\nfinancial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.\\n − Tested the design, implementation and operating\\xa0effectiveness \\nof controls relating to data transmission through the different \\nIT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\nInformation Other than the Financial \\nStatements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\n − The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nother information.

We \\nhave nothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management and \\nThose Charged with Governance for the \\nStandalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \\nthe preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view of the financial position, \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive \\nincome, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company \\nin accordance with the accounting principles generally \\naccepted in India, including Ind AS specified under \\nSection 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes \\nmaintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance \\nwith the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of \\nthe Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and \\nother irregularities; selection and application of appropriate \\naccounting policies; making judgments and estimates that \\nare reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation \\nand maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, \\nthat were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy \\nand completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the \\npreparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements that give a true and fair view and are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, \\nmanagement and Board of Directors is responsible for \\nassessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \\nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting \\nunless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate \\nthe Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic \\nalternative but to do so.\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for \\noverseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the \\nStandalone Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole \\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \\nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted \\nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually \\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis \\nof these Standalone Financial Statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \\nthroughout the audit. We also:\\n − Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or \\nthe override of internal control.\\n − Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls \\nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under \\nSection 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible \\nfor expressing our opinion on whether the Company \\nhas adequate internal financial controls with reference \\nto Standalone Financial Statements in place and the \\noperating effectiveness of such controls.\\n − Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies \\nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \\nand related disclosures made by the management.\\n − Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions \\nthat may cast significant doubt on the Company’s \\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude \\nthat a material uncertainty exists, we are required to \\ndraw attention in our auditor’s report to the related \\ndisclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \\nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit \\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. \\nHowever, future events or conditions may cause the \\nCompany to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n − Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements, including the \\ndisclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial \\nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \\nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \\nStandalone Financial Statements that, individually or in \\naggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions \\nof a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone \\nFinancial Statements may be influenced. We consider \\nquantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning \\nthe scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results \\nof our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified \\nmisstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \\nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \\ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal controls with \\nreference to financial statements that we identify during \\nour audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and to communicate \\nwith them all relationships and other matters that may \\nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and \\nwhere applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \\nmost significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements of the current period and are therefore the key \\naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \\nwe determine that a matter should not be communicated \\nin our report because the adverse consequences of doing \\nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \\ninterest benefits of such communication.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory \\nRequirements\\n1.  As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our \\naudit, we report that:\\n a)  We have sought and obtained all the information \\nand explanations which to the best of our \\nknowledge and belief were necessary for the \\npurposes of our audit.\\n120 Reliance Industries Limited 121Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 62, 'page_label': '63'}, page_content='b)  In our opinion, proper books of account as \\nrequired by law have been kept by the Company \\nso far as it appears from our examination of \\nthose books.\\n c)  The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss including Other Comprehensive Income, \\nthe Statement of Cash Flow and Statement of \\nChanges in Equity dealt with by this Report are in \\nagreement with the books of account.\\n d)  In our opinion, the aforesaid Standalone Financial \\nStatements comply with the Ind AS specified \\nunder Section 133 of the Act.\\n e)  On the basis of the written representations \\nreceived from the directors as on 31st March, \\n2024 taken on record by the Board of Directors, \\nnone of the directors is disqualified as on 31st \\nMarch, 2024 from being appointed as a director \\nin terms of Section 164(2) of the Act.\\n f)  With respect to the adequacy of the internal \\nfinancial controls with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements of the Company and the \\noperating effectiveness of such controls, refer to \\nour separate Report in “Annexure A”.

Material Accounting Policies:\\nB.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation\\n  The Financial Statements have been prepared on \\nthe historical cost basis except for following assets \\nand liabilities which have been measured at fair \\nvalue amount:\\n i)  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities (including \\nderivative instruments),\\n ii) Defined Benefit Plans – Plan Assets and\\n iii) Equity settled Share Based Payments\\n  The Financial Statements of the Company have been \\nprepared to comply with the Indian Accounting \\nstandards (‘Ind AS’), including the Rules notified under \\nthe relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, \\n(as amended from time to time) and Presentation \\nand disclosure requirements of Division II of Schedule \\nIII to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS Compliant \\nSchedule III) as amended from time to time. The \\nCompany follows indirect method prescribed in Ind \\nAS 7 – Statement of Cash Flows for presentation of its \\ncash flows.\\n  The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in \\nIndian Rupees (C), which is also its functional currency \\nand all values are rounded to the nearest crore \\n(C00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.\\nB.2 Summary of Material Accounting Policies\\n (a) Current and Non-Current Classification\\n   The Company presents assets and liabilities in the \\nBalance Sheet based on Current/ Non-Current \\nclassification considering an operating cycle \\nof 12 months being the time elapsed between \\ndeployment of resources and the realisation/ \\nsettlement in cash and cash equivalents there-\\nagainst.\\n (b) Property, Plant and Equipment\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at \\ncost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount \\nand rebates less accumulated depreciation and \\nimpairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing cost and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the assets to \\nits working condition for its intended use, net \\ncharges on foreign exchange contracts and \\nadjustments arising from exchange rate variations \\nattributable to the assets. In case of land the \\nCompany has availed fair value as deemed cost on \\nthe date of transition to Ind AS. \\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to \\nproject, net of income earned during the project \\ndevelopment stage prior to its intended use, \\nare considered as pre-operative expenses and \\ndisclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\\n   Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment \\nis provided using written down value method \\non depreciable amount except in case of certain \\nassets of Oil to Chemicals and Other segment \\nwhich are depreciated using straight line method. \\nDepreciation is provided based on useful life of \\nthe assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 except in respect of the \\nfollowing assets, where useful life is as under:\\nParticular Depreciation\\nFixed Bed Catalyst (useful \\nlife: 2 years or more)\\nOver its useful life as \\ntechnically assessed\\nFixed Bed Catalyst (useful \\nlife: up to 2 years)\\n100% depreciated in the \\nyear of addition\\nPlant and Machinery (useful \\nlife: 25 to 50 years)\\nOver its useful life as \\ntechnically assessed\\nBuildings (Useful life: 30 to \\n65 years)\\nOver its useful life as \\ntechnically assessed\\n   The residual values, useful lives and methods of \\ndepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are \\nreviewed at each financial year end and adjusted \\nprospectively, if appropriate.\\n (c) Leases \\n   The Company, as a lessee, recognises a right-\\nof-use asset and a lease liability for its leasing \\narrangements, if the contract conveys the \\nright to control the use of an identified asset. \\nInitially the right of use assets measured at cost \\nwhich comprises initial cost of the lease liability \\nadjusted for any lease payments made at or \\nbefore the commencement date plus any initial \\ndirect costs incurred. Subsequently measured \\nat cost less any accumulated depreciation/ \\namortisation, accumulated impairment losses, \\nif\\xa0any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the \\nlease liability.\\n   The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised \\nusing the straight-line method from the \\ncommencement date over the shorter of lease \\nterm or useful life of right-of-use asset.\\n   The Company measures the lease liability at the \\npresent value of the lease payments that are not \\npaid at the commencement date of the lease. The \\nlease payments are discounted using the interest \\nrate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be \\nreadily determined. If that rate cannot be readily \\ndetermined, the Company uses incremental \\nborrowing rate.\\n   For short-term and low value leases, the \\nCompany recognises the lease payments as an \\noperating expense on a straight-line basis over the \\nlease term.\\n (d) Intangible Assets\\n   Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition \\nnet of recoverable taxes, trade discount and \\nrebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion \\nand impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the asset to \\nits working condition for the intended use, net \\ncharges on foreign exchange contracts and \\nadjustments arising from exchange rate variations \\nattributable to the Intangible Assets. \\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating \\nto project, net of income earned during \\nthe project development stage prior to its \\nintended use, are considered as pre-operative \\nexpenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nUnder Development.\\n   The Company assesses if useful life of an \\nintangible asset is finite or indefinite. A summary \\nof amortisation/depletion policies applied to the \\nCompany’s Intangible Assets to the extent of \\ndepreciable amount is as follows:\\nParticular Amortisation / Depletion\\nTechnical \\nKnow-How\\nOver the useful life of the underlying \\nassets ranging from 5 years to 35 \\nyears.\\nComputer \\nSoftware\\nOver a period of 5 years.\\nDevelopment \\nRights\\nW.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the \\nunit of production method. The cost of \\nproducing wells along with its related \\nfacilities including decommissioning \\ncosts are depleted in proportion of oil \\nand gas production achieved vis-à-vis \\nProved Developed Reserves. The cost \\nfor common facilities including its \\ndecommissioning costs are depleted \\nusing Proved Reserves. With respect \\nto other development rights, these are \\namortized over the period of contract.\\nParticular Amortisation / Depletion\\nOthers In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount \\namortised to date is not less than \\nthe aggregate rebate availed by the \\nCompany.\\n   The amortisation period and the amortisation \\nmethod for Intangible Assets with a finite useful \\nlife are reviewed at each reporting date.\\n (e) Inventories\\n   Items of inventories are measured at lower of \\ncost and net realisable value after providing \\nfor obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-\\nproducts which are valued at net realisable value. \\n   Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw \\nmaterials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing \\nmaterials, trading and other products are \\ndetermined on weighted average basis.\\n (f) Provisions\\n   Provisions are recognised when the Company \\nhas a present obligation (legal or constructive) \\nas a result of a past event, it is probable that \\nan outflow of resources embodying economic \\nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation \\nand a reliable estimate can be made of the \\namount of the obligation. If the effect of the \\ntime value of money is material, provisions are \\ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \\nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \\nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \\ntime is recognised as a finance cost. \\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Company records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount \\non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding of \\ndiscount is recognised in the Statement of Profit \\nand Loss.\\n (g) Contingent Liabilities\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one \\n138 Reliance Industries Limited 139Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 71, 'page_label': '72'}, page_content='or more uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of the Company or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying \\neconomic benefits will be required to settle or a \\nreliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\\n (h) Current Tax and Deferred Tax\\n   The tax expenses for the period comprise of \\ncurrent tax and deferred tax. The Company \\nexercises judgment in computation of current tax \\nconsidering the relevant rulings and reassesses \\nthe carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the \\nend of each reporting period.\\n (i) Share Based Payments\\n   In case of Group equity-settled share-based \\npayment transactions, where the Company grants \\nstock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, \\nthe transactions are accounted by increasing \\nthe cost of investment in subsidiary with a \\ncorresponding credit in the equity.\\n (j)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency \\nborrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which \\nare related to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost \\nof such assets. \\n (k) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is \\nrecognised when control of the goods or services \\nare transferred to the customer at an amount that \\nreflects the consideration entitled in exchange for \\nthose goods or services. The Company is generally \\nthe principal as it typically controls the goods or \\nservices before transferring them to the customer. \\n   Revenue is measured at the amount of \\nconsideration which the Company expects to be \\nentitled to in exchange for transferring distinct \\ngoods or services to a customer as specified in \\nthe contract, excluding amounts collected on \\nbehalf of third parties (for example taxes and \\nduties collected on behalf of the government). \\nConsideration is generally due upon satisfaction \\nof performance obligations and a receivable is \\nrecognised when it becomes unconditional. \\n   Generally, the credit period varies between \\n0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of \\ngoods or completion of services as the case may \\nbe. The Company provides volume rebates to \\ncertain customers once the quantity of products \\npurchased during the period exceeds a threshold \\nspecified and also accrues discounts to certain \\ncustomers based on customary business practices \\nwhich is derived on the basis of crude price \\nvolatility and various market demand – supply \\nsituations. Consideration are determined based \\non its most likely amount. Generally, sales of \\npetroleum products contain provisional pricing \\nfeatures where revenue is initially recognised \\nbased on provisional price. Difference between \\nfinal settlement price and provisional price is \\nrecognised subsequently. \\n (l) Financial Instruments\\n  i. Financial Assets\\n    Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are \\nrecognised using trade date accounting. \\nTrade receivables that do not contain \\na significant financing component are \\nmeasured at transaction price.\\n    The Company has elected to account for its \\ninvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint \\nventure at cost less impairment loss (if any). \\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Statement of Profit and Loss, except \\nfor those equity investments for which \\nthe Company has elected to present the \\nvalue changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \\nIncome’. However, dividend on such equity \\ninvestments are recognised in Statement \\nof Profit and loss when the Company’s \\nright to receive payment is established. The \\ninvestments in preference shares with the \\nright to surplus assets which are in nature \\nof equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are \\ntreated as separate category of investment \\nand measured at FVTOCI. Other Financial \\nAssets are generally measured at Fair Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL) except \\nwhere the Company, based on the business \\nmodel objectives, measures these at \\nAmortized Cost or Fair Value Through Other \\nComprehensive Income (FVTOCI).\\n    The Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ \\n(ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of \\nFinancial Assets other than those measured \\nat Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).\\n    Expected Credit Losses are measured \\nthrough a loss allowance at an amount \\nequal to: \\n − The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or \\n − Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nall possible default events over the life of \\nthe financial instrument).\\n    For Trade Receivables, the Company \\napplies ‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \\n    The Company uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking estimates \\nare analysed. \\n    For other assets, the Company uses 12 \\nmonth ECL to provide for impairment loss \\nwhere there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in \\ncredit risk full lifetime ECL is used. \\n  ii.  Financial Liabilities\\n    For trade and other payables maturing \\nwithin one year from the balance sheet \\ndate, the carrying amounts are determined \\nto approximate fair value due to the short \\nmaturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting\\n    The Company uses various derivative \\nfinancial instruments such as interest rate \\nswaps, currency swaps, forwards & options \\nand commodity contracts to mitigate the \\nrisk of changes in interest rates, exchange \\nrates and commodity prices. At the inception \\nof a hedge relationship, the Company \\nformally designates and documents the \\nhedge relationship to which the Company \\nwishes to apply hedge accounting and the \\nrisk management objective and strategy for \\nundertaking the hedge.\\n    Any gains or losses arising from changes in \\nthe fair value of derivatives are taken directly \\nto Statement of Profit and Loss, except for \\nthe effective portion of cash flow hedge \\nwhich is recognised in Other Comprehensive \\nIncome and later to Statement of Profit and \\nLoss when the hedged item affects profit \\nor loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a \\nhedged forecast transaction subsequently \\nresults in the recognition of a Non-Financial \\nAssets or Non-Financial liability. \\n    Hedges that meet the criteria  for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows: \\n   A. Cash Flow Hedge\\n     The Company designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets/ Liabilities as hedging \\ninstruments to mitigate the risk of \\nmovement in interest rates and foreign \\nexchange rates for foreign exchange \\nexposure on highly probable future cash \\nflows attributable to a recognised asset \\nor liability or forecast cash transactions. \\n   B. Fair Value Hedge\\n     The Company designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets/Liabilities as hedging \\ninstruments to mitigate the risk of \\nchange in fair value of hedged item due \\nto movement in interest rates, foreign \\nexchange rates and commodity prices. \\n  iv.   Offsetting \\n    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe balance sheet when, and only when, the \\nCompany has a legally enforceable right to \\nset off the amount and it intends, either to \\nsettle them on a net basis or to realise the \\nasset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\n (m) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature \\nof joint operations. Accordingly, assets and \\nliabilities as well as income and expenditure are \\naccounted on the basis of available information \\non a line-by-line basis with similar items in the \\nCompany’s Financial Statements, according to the \\nparticipating interest of the Company.\\n   The Company follows the Guidance Note on \\nAccounting for Oil and Gas producing activities \\n– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered \\nAccountants of India for the purposes of the \\naccounting.  Seismic costs, geological and \\ngeophysical studies, petroleum exploration \\nlicense fees and general and administration costs \\ndirectly attributable to exploration and evaluation \\nactivities are expensed off. The costs incurred on \\nacquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on \\nexploration and evaluation other than those which \\nare expensed off are accounted for as Intangible \\nAssets Under Development. All development \\ncosts incurred in respect of proved reserves are \\nalso capitalised under Intangible Assets Under \\nDevelopment. Once a well is ready to commence \\ncommercial production, the costs accumulated \\n140 Reliance Industries Limited 141Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 72, 'page_label': '73'}, page_content='in Intangible Assets Under Development are \\nclassified as Intangible Assets corresponding \\nto proved developed oil and gas reserves. The \\nexploration and evaluation expenditure which \\ndoes not result in discovery of proved oil and gas \\nreserves and all cost pertaining to production are \\ncharged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\n   The Company uses technical estimation of \\nreserves as per the Petroleum Resources \\nManagement System guidelines 2011 and \\nstandard geological and reservoir engineering \\nmethods. The reserve review and evaluation is \\ncarried out annually.\\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements and \\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements \\nrequires management to make judgement, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \\nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the \\naccompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these \\nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes \\nthat require a material adjustment to the carrying \\namount of assets or liabilities affected in next \\nfinancial years.\\n(A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n  The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and \\nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \\nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \\nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \\nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \\nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \\ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \\non the determination of the Company’s estimates of \\nits oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases \\nit’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement \\nof reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and \\ncommercial assessments based on conventional \\nindustry practice and regulatory requirements.\\n  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used \\nto calculate depletion charges for the Company’s \\noil and gas properties. The impact of changes in \\nestimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively \\nby amortising the remaining carrying value of the \\nasset over the expected future production. Oil and \\nnatural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the \\nassessment of the recoverability of asset carrying \\nvalues reported in the Financial Statements.\\n  Details on proved reserves and production both \\non product and geographical basis are provided in \\nNote\\xa035.2.\\n(B)  Property Plant and Equipment/ Intangible \\nAssets\\n  Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \\ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating in \\nthe manner intended by the management. Property, \\nPlant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/\\namortised over their estimated useful life, after taking \\ninto account estimated residual value. Management \\nreviews the estimated useful life and residual values of \\nthe assets annually in order to determine the amount \\nof depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during \\nany reporting period. The useful life and residual values \\nare based on the Company’s historical experience \\nwith similar assets and take into account anticipated \\ntechnological and future risks. The depreciation/\\namortisation for future periods is revised if there are \\nsignificant changes from previous estimates.\\n(C) Provisions\\n  The timing of recognition and quantification of the \\nliability (including litigations) requires the application \\nof judgement to existing facts and circumstances, \\nwhich can be subject to change. The carrying amounts \\nof provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly \\nand revised to take account of changing facts \\nand circumstances.\\n(D)  Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial \\nAssets\\n  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \\nare based on assumptions about risk of default \\nand expected cash loss rates. The Company uses \\njudgement in making these assumptions and selecting \\nthe inputs to the impairment calculation, based on \\nCompany’s past history, existing market conditions as \\nwell as forward-looking estimates at the end of each \\nreporting period.\\n  In case of non-financial assets, assessment of \\nimpairment indicators involves consideration of \\nfuture risks. Further, the Company estimates asset’s \\nrecoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or \\nCash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of \\ndisposal and its value in use.\\n  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \\nflows are discounted to their present value using \\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \\nspecific to the asset.

An \\nincrease in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\\nSalary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries \\nof plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the \\nplan's liability.\\n  29.2 Share Based Payments\\n   a) Scheme details\\n    The Company has Employees’ Stock Option Scheme i.e. ESOS-2017 under which options have been granted at the \\nexercise price of C 10 per share to be vested from time to time on the basis of performance and other eligibility criteria. \\nDetails of number of options outstanding have been tabulated below: \\nFinancial Year\\n(Year of Grant)\\nNumber of Options Outstanding\\nFinancial Year of Vesting Exercise \\nPrice (K)\\nRange of Fair value at Grant \\nDate (K)\\nAs at  \\n31st March, \\n2024\\nAs at\\n31st March, \\n2023\\nESOS - 2017\\nDetails of Employee Stock Options granted from 1st April, 2020 to 31st March, 2024\\n2020-21 2,00,000 2,00,000 2021-22 to 2024-25 10.00 2,133.40 - 2,151.90\\n2021-22 75,000 90,000 2022-23 to 2025-26 10.00 2,595.20 - 2,613.30\\n2023-24 27,912 - 2024-25 to 2025-26 10.00 2,836.60 - 2,840.70\\nTotal 3,02,912 2,90,000\\n    Exercise period would commence from the date of Vesting and would expire not later than seven years from the Grant \\nDate or such other period as may be decided by the Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration Committee of \\nthe Board.\\n168 Reliance Industries Limited 169Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2024\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 86, 'page_label': '87'}, page_content=\"b) Fair Value on the grant date\\n    The fair value at grant date is determined using “Black Scholes Model” which takes into account the exercise price, term \\nof the option, share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying shares, expected dividend yield and \\nthe risk free interest rate for the term of the option.\\n    The model inputs for options granted during the year ended 31st March, 2021, 31st March, 2022 and 31st March, 2024 \\nare mentioned below:\\nESOS - 2017\\na) Weighted average exercise price C 10 C 10 C 10\\nb) Grant date: 05.10.2020 30.03.2022 26.03.2024\\nc) Vesting year: 2021-22 to \\n2024-25\\n2022-23 to \\n2025-26\\n2024-2025 to \\n2025-2026\\nd) Share Price at grant date: C 2,212 C 2,673 C 2,883\\ne) Expected price volatility of Company's share: 30.20% to \\n31.90%\\n30.70% to \\n33.00%\\n27.27% to  \\n30.50%\\nf) Expected dividend yield: 0.60% 0.49% 0.30%\\ng) Risk free interest rate: 5.10% to 5.60% 5.86% to 6.34% 7.00% to 7.01%\\n   The expected price volatility is based on the historic volatility (based on remaining life of the options).\\n  c) Movement in share options during the year:\\nParticulars\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at \\n31st March, 2023\\nNumber of share \\noptions\\nWeighted average \\nexercise price\\nNumber of share \\noptions\\nWeighted average \\nexercise price\\nBalance at the beginning of the year 2,90,000 10.00 3,90,000 10.00\\nGranted during the year 27,912 10.00 - -\\nExercised during the year (15,000) 10.00 (1,00,000) 10.00\\nBalance at the end of the year 3,02,912 10.00 2,90,000 10.00\\n    Weighted average remaining contractual life of the share option outstanding at the end of the year is 1,533 days (Previous \\nYear 1,817 days).\\n(C in crore)\\n2023-24 2022-23\\n30.

The GOI had directed the Company to \\ninstruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the \\nguidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited \\nto the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 \\ncrore (net) as at 31st March, 2024.

This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under \\ncost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. \\n 35.4  (a)  The Government of India (GOI) sent a notice to the KG-D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to \\ndeposit approximately US $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as Operator, for \\nand on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair \\nclaim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an Appeal \\non 15th November, 2018 before the Single Judge Bench of Hon’ble Delhi High Court (DHC), against the Final Award. \\nVide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023 the Hon’ble Single Judge of DHC upheld the Arbitration Award and dismissed GOI’s \\nappeal challenging the Award.

The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this \\nmatter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be \\nissued. The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in \\ncourt judgments that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour.\\n  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a \\nperiod of 17 years.

Financial Risk Management\\n  The Company’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), \\ncommodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, \\nthe Company uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its \\nfinancial performance. \\n i) Market Risk\\n   Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in \\nmarket prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity \\nprice risk and commodity risk.\\n  a) Foreign Currency Risk\\n    Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes \\nin foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are denominated in \\ncurrencies other than Indian Rupee.\\n    The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments at the \\nend of the reporting period.

The Company issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market \\nopportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.\\n    The exposure of the Company’s borrowings and derivatives to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are \\nas follows:\\n(C in crore) \\nParticulars\\nInterest Rate Exposure\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at \\n31st March, 2023\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current - Floating (includes Current Maturities) * 99,340 93,073\\nNon-Current - Fixed (includes Current Maturities) * 96,311 87,426\\nCurrent 17,298 36,372\\nTotal 2,12,949 2,16,871\\nDerivatives \\nForeign Currency Interest Rate Swaps \\n- Receive Fix 10,376 2,136\\n- Pay Fix 8,090 9,943\\nRupees Interest Rate Swaps\\n- Receive Fix 32,195 20,790\\n- Pay Fix 25,515 20,510\\n   * Including C 1,159 Crore (Previous Year C 1,048 Crore) of prepaid financial charges and fair valuation impact.\\n   Sensitivity analysis of 1% change in Interest rate\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars\\nInterest rate Sensitivity\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at\\n31st March, 2023\\nUp Move Down Move Up Move Down Move\\nImpact on Equity  (407)  330  (357)  316 \\nImpact on P&L  (509) 449  (500) 438\\nTotal Impact  (916) 779  (857)  754 \\n ii) Commodity Price Risk\\n   Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products. The Company has a risk \\nmanagement framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs. \\n   The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In \\naccordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-\\ncounter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\\n iii) Credit Risk\\n   Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing \\nfinancial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from Company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables \\nfrom customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. \\nInvestment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly \\nshared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of \\ncredit deterioration. \\n194 Reliance Industries Limited 195Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 99, 'page_label': '100'}, page_content='The Company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. \\nCredit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent company Guarantees, advance payments \\nand factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the Company to avoid concentration of risk. The Company restricts its fixed \\nincome investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n iv) Liquidity Risk\\n   Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Company maintains \\nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Company accesses global and local financial \\nmarkets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from \\nacross well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s cash flow position and \\nensures that the Company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\\n   The Company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury \\npools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the \\nnet surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, \\nreverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one \\ninstrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars ^\\nMaturity Profile as at 31st March, 2024\\nBelow  \\n3 Months 3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above  \\n5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current *@ 9,936 2,587 21,143 34,149 61,009 66,827 1,95,651\\nCurrent $ 17,298  -  -  -  -  - 17,298\\nTotal 27,234 2,587 21,143 34,149 61,009 66,827 2,12,949\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 81 81 150 552 552 4,024 5,440\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 759 447 650 49 57  - 1,962\\nOptions 62 10 23 33 36  - 164\\nInterest Rate Swaps  -  - 2 34 260  3 299\\nTotal 821 457 675 116 353 3 2,425\\n  ^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) of C 1,29,859 crore.\\n  * Including C 1,159 crore as prepaid financial charges and fair valuation impact.\\n  @ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4).\\n  $ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 6.8% to 8.5%.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars ^\\nMaturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023\\nBelow  \\n3 Months 3-6 Months 6-12 Months 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Above  \\n5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current *@ 12,633 7,389 24,053 56,150 21,040 59,234 1,80,499\\nCurrent $ 33,985 2,387 0 0 0 0 36,372\\nTotal 46,618 9,776 24,053 56,150 21,040 59,234 2,16,871\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 81 81 161 587 552 4,301 5,763\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards 645 389 314 71 4 0 1,423\\nOptions 103 20 63 35 0 0 221\\nInterest Rate Swaps 3 13 44 38 46 3 147\\nTotal 751 422 421 144 50  3 1,791\\n  ^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) of C 1,19,811 crore.\\n  * Including C 1,048 crore as prepaid financial charges and fair valuation impact.\\n  @ Does not include interest thereon (for interest rate Refer Note 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4).\\n  $ Interest rate of current borrowings ranges from 5.6% to 8.5%.\\nC. Hedge Accounting\\n  The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other \\nfeedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured \\nrisk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which \\nallows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter \\nswaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\\n  There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge \\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the Dollar Offset method and critical \\nterm matching method.\\n The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. \\n The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\\n A.

Revenue Recognition\\n(a)  The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), \\na step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported \\nrevenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high \\nvolumes of data processed by the IT systems and the \\ncomplexity of those IT systems.\\nIn respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \\nRJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by \\nthem to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary \\nauditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and \\nwere not limited to the following:\\n − Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and \\noperating effectiveness of the relevant business process \\ncontrols, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement \\nand authorisation of revenue transactions, involving internal \\nInformation Technology (IT) specialists for the automated \\ncontrols, interface controls and reports generated through \\nvarious relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.\\n − Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment \\ninter-alia for access controls, change management and \\napplication specific controls in the IT Systems over RJIL’s billing \\nand other relevant support systems.\\n − Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue \\nper the billing system and the financial records. Performed \\nprocedures to test the computation of revenue and \\ndeferred revenue.\\n(b)  The auditors of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (‘RRVL’), \\na subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue \\nrecognition as a key audit matter at its subsidiary \\nviz., Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’). RRL is engaged in \\norganised retail and the trading transactions generating \\nrevenue comprising of high volume of individually small \\ntransactions which increases the risk of revenue being \\nrecognised inappropriately and which highlights the \\ncriticality of sound internal processes of summarising \\nand recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption \\nbaskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of \\nconsideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised \\non transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. \\nTransfer of control coincides with collection of cash or \\ncash equivalent from customers. In view of the above \\nand since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, \\nrevenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.\\nIn respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \\nRRVL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by \\nthem to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary \\nauditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and \\nwere not limited to the following:\\n − Obtained understanding of the process followed by the \\nmanagement to record the revenue from each store.\\n − Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of \\nthe internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of \\nrevenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.\\n − Involved information technology specialist to test the \\nautomated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation \\nof revenue.\\n − On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various \\ndates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue \\nrecorded through various modes of payment from RRL’s \\naccounting system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such \\ndetails with the underlying collection made by RRL as per \\ncash receipts, merchant payment reports, and other third \\nparty supporting.\\n4. Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \\nfinancial reporting\\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \\nas a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial \\naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant \\non IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction \\nvolumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material \\nconsumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and \\nthe increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Parent’s \\nsystems and data, cyber security has become more significant. \\nAutomated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, \\nwhich include IT governance, IT general controls over program \\ndevelopment and changes, access to program and data and\\nOur procedures included and were not limited to the following:\\n − Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging \\nIT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and \\ninternal audit at the Parent and identified IT applications that \\nare relevant to our audit.\\n − Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT general controls over program development and changes, \\naccess to program and data and IT operations by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\nSr. \\nNo. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response\\nIT operations, IT application controls and interfaces between \\nIT applications, are required to be designed and to operate \\neffectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.\\n − Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cyber security \\nat the Parent in respect of the overall security architecture and \\nany key threats addressed by the Parent in the current year.\\n − Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof IT application controls in the key processes impacting \\nfinancial reporting of the Parent by engaging IT specialists.\\n − Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \\nof controls relating to data transmission through the different \\nIT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging \\nIT specialists.\\nInformation Other than the Financial \\nStatements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\n − The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nother information. The other information comprises the \\ninformation included in the Annual Report, but does \\nnot include the Consolidated Financial Statements, \\nStandalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s \\nreport thereon.\\n − Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \\ndoes not cover the other information and we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n − In connection with our audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements, our responsibility is to read \\nthe other information, compare with the financial \\nstatements / financial information of the joint \\noperations, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates \\naudited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates \\nto these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the \\nwork of the other auditors and consider whether the \\nother information is materially inconsistent with the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge \\nobtained during the course of our audit or otherwise \\nappears to be materially misstated. Other information \\nso far as it relates to the joint operations, subsidiaries, \\njoint ventures and associates, is traced from their \\nfinancial statements / financial information audited by \\nthe other auditors.\\n − If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \\nthat there is a material misstatement of this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We \\nhave nothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management and \\nThose Charged with Governance for the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\nThe Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \\nthe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements \\nthat give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial \\nposition, consolidated financial performance including \\nother comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows \\nand consolidated changes in equity of the Group including \\nits associates and joint ventures in accordance with the \\naccounting principles generally accepted in India including \\nInd AS specified under Section 133 of the Act.

Subsequently measured \\nat cost less any accumulated depreciation/ \\namortisation, accumulated impairment losses, if \\nany and adjusted for any remeasurement of the \\nlease liability.\\n   The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised \\nusing the straight-line method from the \\ncommencement date over the shorter of lease \\nterm or useful life of right-of-use asset.\\n   The Group measures the lease liability at the \\npresent value of the lease payments that are not \\npaid at the commencement date of the lease. \\nThe lease payments are discounted using the \\ninterest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can \\nbe readily determined. If that rate cannot be \\nreadily determined, the Group uses incremental \\nborrowing rate.\\n   For short-term and low value leases, the Group \\nrecognises the lease payments as an operating \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the \\nlease term.\\n (e) Intangible Assets\\n   Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition \\nnet of recoverable taxes, trade discount and \\nrebate less accumulated amortisation / depletion \\nand impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes \\npurchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost \\ndirectly attributable to bringing the asset to \\nits working condition for the intended use, net \\ncharges on foreign exchange contracts and \\nadjustments arising from exchange rate variations \\nattributable to the Intangible Assets.\\n   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating \\nto project, net of income earned during \\nthe project development stage prior to its \\nintended use, are considered as pre-operative \\nexpenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets \\nUnder Development.\\n   The Group assesses if useful life of an intangible \\nasset is finite or indefinite.\\n   A summary of the amortisation / depletion policies \\napplied to the Group’s Intangible Assets with a \\nfinite life to the extent of depreciable amount is \\nas follows.\\nParticulars Amortization\\nTechnical \\nKnow-How\\nOver the useful life of the underlying \\nassets ranging from 5 years to 35 years\\nComputer \\nSoftware\\nOver a period of 5 to 10 years.\\nDevelopment \\nRights\\nWith respect to Oil and Gas, depleted \\nusing the unit of production method. \\nThe cost of producing wells along \\nwith its related facilities including \\ndecommissioning costs are depleted \\nin proportion of oil and gas production \\nachieved vis-à-vis Proved Developed \\nReserves.

If the effect of the \\ntime value of money is material, provisions are \\ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \\nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \\nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \\ntime is recognised as a finance cost. \\n  Provision for Decommissioning Liability\\n   The Group records a provision for \\ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \\nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \\nat the present value of future expenditure using \\na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \\nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \\nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \\nassets. Any change in the present value of the \\nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount \\non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \\nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \\nchange in the provision due to the unwinding \\nof discount is recognised in the Consolidated \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n (h) Contingent Liabilities\\n   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \\nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \\nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \\nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one \\nor more uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of the Group or a present obligation \\nthat arises from past events where it is either not \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying \\neconomic benefits will be required to settle or a \\nreliable estimate of amount cannot be made. \\n (i) Current Tax and Deferred Tax \\n   The tax expenses for the period comprise \\nof current tax and deferred tax. The Group \\nexercises judgment in computation of current tax \\nconsidering the relevant rulings and reassesses \\nthe carrying amount of deferred tax assets / \\nliabilities at the end of each reporting period. \\n (j) Share Based Payments\\n   In case of Group equity-settled share-based \\npayment transactions, where the Company grants \\nstock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, \\nthe transactions are accounted by increasing \\nthe cost of investment in subsidiary with a \\ncorresponding credit in the equity. \\n (k)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and \\nTranslation\\n   Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency \\nborrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which \\nare related to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost \\nof such assets.\\n (l) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue from contracts with customers is \\nrecognised when control of the goods or services \\nare transferred to the customer at an amount that \\nreflects the consideration entitled in exchange for \\nthose goods or services. The Group is generally \\nthe principal as it typically controls the goods or \\nservices before transferring them to the customer.\\n   Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration \\nwhich the Group expects to be entitled to in \\nexchange for transferring distinct goods or \\nservices to a customer as specified in the contract, \\nexcluding amounts collected on behalf of third \\nparties (for example taxes and duties collected \\non behalf of the government). Consideration is \\ngenerally due upon satisfaction of performance \\nobligations and a receivable is recognised when it \\nbecomes unconditional. \\n   Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 \\ndays from the shipment or delivery of goods or \\ncompletion of services as the case may be. The \\nGroup provides volume rebates to certain customers \\nonce the quantity of products purchased during \\nthe period exceeds a threshold specified and also \\naccrues discounts to certain customers based on \\ncustomary business practices which is derived \\non the basis of crude price volatility and various \\nmarket demand – supply situations. Consideration \\nare determined based on its most likely amount. \\nGenerally, sales of petroleum products contain \\nprovisional pricing features where revenue is initially \\nrecognised based on provisional price. Difference \\nbetween final settlement price and provisional price \\nis recognised subsequently.\\n (m) Financial Instruments\\n  i. Financial Assets\\n    Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are \\nrecognised using trade date accounting. \\nTrade receivables that do not contain \\na significant financing component are \\nmeasured at transaction price.\\n    The Company has elected to account for its \\ninvestments in associates and joint venture at \\ncost less impairment loss (if any). \\n    All other equity investments are measured \\nat fair value, with value changes recognised \\nin Statement of Profit and Loss, except \\nfor those equity investments for which \\nthe Group has elected to present the \\nvalue changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \\nIncome’. However, dividend on such equity \\ninvestments are recognised in Statement \\nof Profit and Loss when the Company’s \\nright to receive payment is established. The \\ninvestments in preference shares with the \\nright to surplus assets which are in nature \\nof equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are \\ntreated as separate category of investment \\nand measured at Fair Value Through Other \\nComprehensive Income (FVTOCI). Other \\nFinancial Assets are generally measured at \\nFair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \\nexcept where the Group, based on the \\nbusiness model objectives, measures these \\nat Amortized Cost or Fair Value Through \\nOther Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).\\n    The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) \\nmodel, for evaluating impairment of Financial \\nAssets other than those measured at Fair \\nValue Through Profit Or Loss (FVTPL).\\n    Expected Credit Losses are measured \\nthrough a loss allowance at an amount \\nequal to: \\n − The 12-months expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nthose default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting date); or \\n − Full lifetime expected credit losses \\n(expected credit losses that result from \\nall possible default events over the life of \\nthe financial instrument).\\n    For Trade Receivables, the Group applies \\n‘simplified approach’ which requires \\nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \\n    The Group uses historical default rates to \\ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \\nthese historical default rates are reviewed \\nand changes in the forward-looking estimates \\nare analysed.\\n    For other assets, the Group uses 12 month \\nECL to provide for impairment loss where \\nthere is no significant increase in credit risk. \\nIf there is significant increase in credit risk \\nfull lifetime ECL is used. \\n  ii.  Financial Liabilities \\n    For trade and other payables maturing \\nwithin one year from the balance sheet \\ndate, the carrying amounts are determined \\nto approximate fair value due to the short \\nmaturity of these instruments.\\n  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and \\nHedge Accounting \\n    The Group uses various derivative financial \\ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, \\ncurrency swaps, forwards & options and \\ncommodity contracts to mitigate the risk \\nof changes in interest rates, exchange rates \\nand commodity prices. At the inception of \\na hedge relationship, the Group formally \\ndesignates and documents the hedge \\nrelationship to which the Group wishes \\nto apply hedge accounting and the risk \\nmanagement objective and strategy for \\nundertaking the hedge. \\n    Any gains or losses arising from changes in \\nthe fair value of derivatives are taken directly \\nto Statement of Profit and Loss, except for \\nthe effective portion of cash flow hedge \\nwhich is recognised in Other Comprehensive \\nIncome and later to Statement of Profit and \\nLoss when the hedged item affects profit \\nor loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a \\nhedged forecast transaction subsequently \\nresults in the recognition of a Non-Financial \\nAssets or Non-Financial liabilities. \\n226 Reliance Industries Limited 227Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 115, 'page_label': '116'}, page_content='Hedges that meet the criteria  for hedge \\naccounting are accounted for as follows: \\n   A. Cash Flow Hedge \\n     The Group designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets / Liabilities as hedging \\ninstruments to mitigate the risk of \\nmovement in interest rates and foreign \\nexchange rates for foreign exchange \\nexposure on highly probable future cash \\nflows attributable to a recognised asset \\nor liability or forecast cash transactions. \\n   B. Fair Value Hedge \\n     The Group designates derivative \\ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \\nAssets / Liabilities as hedging \\ninstruments to mitigate the risk of \\nchange in fair value of hedged item due \\nto movement in interest rates, foreign \\nexchange rates and commodity prices.\\n  iv.  Offsetting \\n    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are \\noffset and the net amount is presented in \\nthe balance sheet when, and only when, the \\nGroup has a legally enforceable right to set \\noff the amount and it intends, either to settle \\nthem on a net basis or to realise the asset \\nand settle the liability simultaneously. \\n (n) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\\n   Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of \\njoint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities \\nas well as income and expenditure are accounted \\non the basis of available information on a line-by-\\nline basis with similar items in the Financial \\nStatements, according to the participating \\ninterest of the Group.\\n   The Group follows the Guidance Note on \\nAccounting for Oil and Gas producing activities \\n– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered \\nAccountants of India for the purpose of \\naccounting.  Seismic costs, geological and \\ngeophysical studies, petroleum exploration \\nlicense fees and general and administration costs \\ndirectly attributable to exploration and evaluation \\nactivities are expensed off. The costs incurred on \\nacquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on \\nexploration and evaluation other than those which \\nare expensed off are accounted for as Intangible \\nAssets Under Development. All development \\ncosts incurred in respect of proved reserves are \\nalso capitalised under Intangible Assets Under \\nDevelopment. Once a well is ready to commence \\ncommercial production, the costs accumulated \\nin Intangible Assets Under Development are \\nclassified as Intangible Assets corresponding \\nto proved developed oil and gas reserves. The \\nexploration and evaluation expenditure which \\ndoes not result in discovery of proved oil and gas \\nreserves and all cost pertaining to production are \\ncharged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\n   The Group uses technical estimation of reserves \\nas per the Petroleum Resources Management \\nSystem guidelines 2011 and standard geological \\nand reservoir engineering methods. The reserve \\nreview and evaluation is carried out annually. \\nC.  Critical Accounting Judgements and \\nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\\n  The preparation of the Group’s financial statements \\nrequire management to make judgement, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \\nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the \\naccompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these \\nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes \\nthat require a material adjustment to the carrying \\namount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\\n (A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\\n   The determination of the Group’s estimated \\noil and natural gas reserves require significant \\njudgements and estimates to be applied and these \\nare regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such \\nas the availability of geological and engineering \\ndata, reservoir performance data, acquisition \\nand divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and \\ncommodity prices all impact on the determination \\nof the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas \\nreserves. The Group bases it’s proved reserves \\nestimates on the requirement of reasonable \\ncertainty with rigorous technical and commercial \\nassessments based on conventional industry \\npractice and regulatory requirements.\\n   Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are \\nused to calculate depletion charges for the \\nGroup’s oil and gas properties. The impact of \\nchanges in estimated proved reserves is dealt \\nwith prospectively by amortising the remaining \\ncarrying value of the asset over the expected \\nfuture production. Oil and natural gas reserves \\nalso have a direct impact on the assessment of the \\nrecoverability of asset carrying values reported in \\nthe financial statements.\\n   Details on proved reserves and production both \\non product and geographical basis are provided in \\nNote 34.\\n (B)  Property Plant and Equipment / Other \\nIntangible Assets\\n   Estimates are involved in determining the cost \\nattributable to bringing the assets to the location \\nand condition necessary for it to be capable \\nof operating in the manner intended by the \\nmanagement. Property, Plant and Equipment\\xa0/ \\nOther Intangible Assets are depreciated\\xa0/  \\namortised over their estimated useful life, \\nafter taking into account estimated residual \\nvalue. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its \\nbalance validity period, based on the expected \\npattern of consumption of the expected future \\neconomic benefits.\\n   Management reviews the estimated useful life \\nand residual values of the assets annually in \\norder to determine the amount of depreciation / \\namortisation to be recorded during any reporting \\nperiod. The useful life and residual values are \\nbased on the Group’s historical experience with \\nsimilar assets and take into account anticipated \\ntechnological and future risks. The depreciation / \\namortisation for future periods is revised if there \\nare significant changes from previous estimates.\\n (C) Provisions\\n   The timing of recognition and quantification of \\nthe liability (including litigations) requires the \\napplication of judgement to existing facts and \\ncircumstances, which can be subject to change. \\nThe carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities \\nare reviewed regularly and revised to take account \\nof changing facts and circumstances.\\n (D)  Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible \\nAssets under Development and Intangible \\nAssets with Indefinite Useful Life\\n   Management reviews the carrying value of \\ngoodwill, intangible assets under development \\nand intangible assets with indefinite useful \\nlife annually, to determine whether there has \\nbeen any impairment by allocating the value of \\ngoodwill, intangible assets under development \\nand intangible assets with indefinite useful life \\nto a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has \\nidentified CGUs’ for this purpose, considering \\nthe nature of the businesses to which each of the \\nCGU relates.\\n   Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU \\nis aggregate of cash flow projections, for five \\nyears as approved by Senior Management and \\nbeyond five years extrapolated using a long-term \\ngrowth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash \\nflow projections are discounted by a pre-tax \\ndiscount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of \\nCapital (WACC), which ranges from 8% to 12%.\\n   The Management believes that any reasonably \\npossible change in the above key assumptions on \\nwhich recoverable amount is based would not \\ncause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed \\nthe aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.\\n   Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite \\nlives have been allocated to the respective CGUs. \\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the \\nGroup has determined that there is no impairment \\ntowards these assets.\\n (E)  Impairment of Financial and \\nNon-Financial Assets\\n   The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \\nare based on assumptions about risk of default \\nand expected cash loss rates. The Group uses \\njudgement in making these assumptions and \\nselecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, \\nbased on Group’s past history, existing market \\nconditions as well as forward-looking estimates at \\nthe end of each reporting period.\\n   In case of non-financial assets, the Group \\nestimates asset’s recoverable amount, which \\nis higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Units \\n(CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its \\nvalue in use.\\n   In assessing value in use, the estimated future \\ncash flows are discounted to their present value \\nusing pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \\nmarket assessments of the time value of money \\nand the risks specific to the asset. In determining \\nfair value less costs of disposal, recent market \\ntransactions are taken into account, if no such \\ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate \\nvaluation model is used.  \\n (F) Fair Value Measurement\\n   For estimates relating to fair value of financial \\ninstruments refer Note 37 of Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n (G) Leases\\n   The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies \\nto be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS \\n116. Identification of a lease requires significant \\njudgement. The Group uses judgement in \\nassessing whether a contract (or part of contract) \\ninclude a lease, the lease term (including \\nanticipated renewals), the applicable discount \\nrate, variable lease payments whether are \\nin-substance fixed. The judgement involves \\nassessment of whether the asset included in the \\ncontract is a fully or partly identified asset based \\non the facts and circumstances, whether the \\ncontract include a lease and non-lease component \\nand if so, separation thereof for the purpose of \\nrecognition and measurement, determination of \\nlease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable \\nperiod of lease and whether the lessee intends \\nto opt for continuing with the use of the asset \\nupon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease \\npayments are fixed are variable or a combination \\nof both.\\n228 Reliance Industries Limited 229Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 116, 'page_label': '117'}, page_content='1.

The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this \\nmatter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour.

The appeal of RIL and others had been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court \\nof India. By its order dated December 17 , 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the \\nInvestors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, \\npending the appeal.

Financial Risk Management\\n   The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within \\nthe boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the \\nvolatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its financial performance.\\n  i)  Market Risk\\n    Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes \\nin market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as \\nequity price risk and commodity risk.\\n   a)  Foreign Currency Risk\\n     Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are \\ndenominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.\\n     The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments \\nat the end of the reporting period.

The Group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market \\nopportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.\\n     The exposure of the Group’s borrowings and derivatives to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period \\nare as follows:\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars\\nInterest Rate Exposure\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current - Floating (Includes Current Maturities) * 1,47,418 1,21,093\\nNon-Current - Fixed (Includes Current Maturities) * 1,22,254 1,11,932\\nCurrent # 56,868 82,577\\nTotal 3,26,540 3,15,602\\nDerivatives\\nForeign Currency Interest Rate Swaps  18,466 12,079\\nRupees Interest Rate Swaps  66,420 50,500\\n    *  Includes C 1,582 crore (Previous Year C 1,190 crore) as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 110 crore (Previous Year C 127 crore) as \\nfair valuation impact.\\n    # Includes C 226 crore (Previous Year C 319 crore) as Commercial Paper Discount.\\n  ii) Commodity Price Risk\\n    Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The Group \\nhas a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices \\nand freight costs.\\n    The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control \\nprocesses. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives \\nand uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and \\nfreight exposure.\\n  iii)  Credit Risk\\n    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due \\ncausing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and \\nreceivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to \\ncustomers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance \\nfunction, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\\n    The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group \\nGuarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group \\nrestricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n  iv)  Liquidity Risk\\n    Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains \\nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local \\nfinancial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient \\nfunding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash \\nflow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\\n    The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury \\npools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or \\ninvest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, \\nmoney market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid \\nconcentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars\\nMaturity Profile As at 31st March, 2024 *\\nBelow\\n3 Months\\n3-6  \\nMonths\\n6-12  \\nMonths\\n1-3  \\nYears\\n3-5  \\nYears\\nAbove  \\n5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current #@  10,675  5,945  28,897  59,432  96,280  68,443  2,69,672 \\nCurrent ^  56,462  253  153  -    -    -    56,868 \\nTotal  67,137  6,198  29,050  59,432  96,280  68,443  3,26,540 \\nLease Liabilities (Gross)  1,591  1,401  2,692  9,680 4,725  16,854 36,943\\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards  1,858  820 812  93 62  -   3,645\\nOptions  62  10  23  33  36  -    164 \\nCurrency Swaps - - 2 34 260 3 299\\nInterest Rate Swaps  4    -    -    126  -  -    130\\nTotal  1,924  830 837  286 358  3 4,238\\n   * Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,78,377 crore.\\n   # Includes C 1,582 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 110 crore as fair valuation impact.\\n   @ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n   ^ Includes C 226 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\\n276 Reliance Industries Limited 277Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\\nNotes\\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2024'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.5 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-08-07T11:55:42+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-07T11:59:55+05:30', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'RIL_IAR_2024.pdf', 'total_pages': 159, 'page': 140, 'page_label': '141'}, page_content='(C in crore)\\nParticulars\\nMaturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023 *\\nBelow\\n3 Months\\n3-6\\nMonths\\n6-12\\nMonths\\n1-3\\nYears\\n3-5\\nYears\\nAbove\\n5 Years Total\\nBorrowings\\nNon-Current #@ 13,449 8,594 27,254 78,290 42,750 62,688  2,33,025 \\nCurrent ^ 77,761 3,500 1,316  -    -    -    82,577 \\nTotal 91,210 12,094 28,570 78,290 42,750 62,688 3,15,602\\nLease Liabilities (Gross) 1,491 1,495 2,877 8,820 6,327 15,153  36,163 \\nDerivative Liabilities\\nForwards  2,658  3,102  405  71  4  -    6,240 \\nOptions  106  20  63  35  -    -   224\\nInterest Rate Swaps  3  13  44  97  139  3 299\\nTotal  2,767  3,135  512  203  143  3 6,763\\n   * Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,47,172  c r o r e .\\n   # Includes C 1,190 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 127 crore as fair valuation impact.\\n   @ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\\n   ^ Includes C 319 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\\n C. Hedge Accounting\\n   The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other \\nfeedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has \\nadopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge \\naccounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded \\nfutures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this \\nobjective. \\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge \\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method \\nand Dollar offset method.\\n  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.\\n  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n  Disclosure of effect of Hedge Accounting:\\n  A.
